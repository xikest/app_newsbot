# 🤖 AI-Powered Daily News Briefing System

> This project is an automated system that collects news headlines throughout the day, then uses an AI model to generate a single, comprehensive "Daily Briefing" that analyzes the day's key trends, topics, and market sentiment.

The goal is to connect the dots between scattered headlines, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

### 🤔 How It Works: The Core Logic

This system operates on a "collect-then-analyze" principle, ensuring you receive a high-signal, low-noise summary once a day.

1.  **24/7 Headline Collection:** It silently monitors and aggregates headlines from a predefined list of RSS feeds throughout the day.

2.  **End-of-Day AI Analysis:** After midnight, all collected headlines from the day are bundled together and sent to an AI for a holistic analysis.

3.  **A Single, Consolidated Briefing:** The AI generates a comprehensive report covering the day's key events, major topics, and overall market sentiment. This final briefing is then delivered to a designated Telegram channel.

### 🛠️ Key Technologies & Design Philosophy

This project was built with stability and scalability in mind, utilizing modern technologies and design patterns.

* **Asynchronous Processing:**
    The entire system is built on an asynchronous architecture using `asyncio` and `aiohttp`. This allows for efficient, non-blocking I/O operations, making it capable of handling a large number of data sources simultaneously.

* **AI-Powered Analysis:**
    Instead of just listing data, this project focuses on deriving context and insight from it. It leverages Large Language Models from AI services to analyze the collective meaning behind dozens of headlines.

* **Scalability & Maintainability:**
    Designed for robust operation, it separates sensitive credentials via environment variables (`.env`), uses `Google Firestore` for persistent data storage to prevent duplicate alerts, and is structured for containerized deployment with `Docker`.

* **API-Driven:**
    The system is wrapped in a `FastAPI` server, allowing it to be triggered by scheduled tasks (like cron jobs) or other external API calls.
